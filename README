1.follow the instructions in the jupyter fule. the fist file, best_moving_average, Scans the market for stocks that hit a golden cross and the 50 day moving average stayed 
above the 200 for the past 2 weeks to makes sure it does not generate false signals. 
2. The second file, best_moving_average2, is a slightly modified version that scans the market for stocks that hit a golden cross,ie the 50 day moving 
average crossed the 200 day moving average, within the last 30 days. The point of this change is to look for stocks that recently hit a golden cross so 
that an investor can get into the stock while the move is still early rather than get into the stock when its been gaining for a while. The second file 
also includes more tickers to run based off of market cap.
